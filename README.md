# Logbook
## 0.0.0.1
In this version it was just a test of how a browser extension worked. It was decided to use an API of an online game to test, where it connects through the profile ID in which the player is logged in and to keep that saved, localStorage was used. It is possible to see a card with the player's profile and information such as username, level, XP and golds (game economy) in addition to the item search page. The API returns a JSON, where it is handled by javascript and shown on the screen. A concept of screens on the same html page was also adopted, making it possible to change between them by javascript (this makes the exchange between them faster and avoids showing loadings).

## 0.0.0.2
In this version, still in alpha, a notes feature for projects has been added. It is very interesting to learn how to save data in localStorage and recover it, treating and creating elements in the DOM according to what was recovered. Styles have also been changed to make it more beautiful and code improvements.
