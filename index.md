# This is the KoGaMa Pocket!

KoGaMa Pocket brings some interesting features to kogama through a popup extension in your browser. This extension was made independently and IS NOT affiliated with Multiverse ApS.

In this version you will be able to monitor your main KoGaMa profile, get information on the wiki about your emblems and search for models and avatars. Probably more features in the future.

## How to connect your account
To connect your account is very simple. You must first be logged in to a KoGaMa server and obtain your profile ID, with that you can put the extension so that it is connected with your account (it will only work while you are logged in). Here's an example:

## Download

### Browsers:
[Microsoft Edge (Chromium)](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/kogama-pocket/gchjcnoeipcpcaofapohombligjpijie) | [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/kogama-pocket/) | [Opera](https://addons.opera.com/en-US/extensions/details/kogama-pocket/)

### And in Chrome and other browsers?
Unfortunately, the **Chrome Web Store** charges a $5 fee to create a developer account to publish the extension. In addition, it is not feasible to publish in all extension stores. If it is not listed in the downloads, you can download .crx package and install it just by dragging the file to your browser. [Download CRX file](https://github.com/mblithium/KoGaMa-Pocket/releases)

You can see a simple example of this as follows:
