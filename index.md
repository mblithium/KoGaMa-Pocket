# This is the KoGaMa Pocket!

KoGaMa Pocket brings some interesting features to kogama through a popup extension in your browser. This extension was made independently and IS NOT affiliated with Multiverse ApS.

In this version you will be able to monitor your main KoGaMa profile, get information on the wiki about your emblems and search for models and avatars. Probably more features in the future.
